      <h2>Intercooler Dependencies</h2>

      <p>One of the novel features of Intercooler is its dependency framework.  This is how Intercooler figures out
      what elements to refresh and when, based on user input, poll intervals, etc.</p>

      <p>The core concept in Intercooler is to use server paths to encode dependencies.  The idea is fairly
      straight forward, given a REST-ful understanding of web addressses:</p>

      <blockquote>If an element reads its value (i.e. issues a <code>GET</code>) from a given server path, and
        an action updates that path (i.e. issues a <code>POST</code> to it), then we should refresh the
      element after the action occurs.</blockquote>

      <p>So, as a simple example, consider this button and div:</p>

      <pre>

  &lt;button ic-post-to="/example/path">A Button&lt;/button>

  &lt;div ic-src="/example/path">A Div&lt;/div>
     </pre>

     <p>Here the div <em>depends</em> on the button, because they share a path with one another.  When
     Intercooler issues a <code>POST</code> to the given path (on a user click), upon completion,
       it will issue a <code>GET</code> to the same path, and replace the div with the new content, if it
       is different.
     </p>

      <h3>What Paths Depend On What?</h3>

      <p>It's all very simple when the <code>POST</code> and <code>GET</code> are to the same path, but what if
        they aren't? What if the post is to <code>/jobs/2341/start</code> and the get is from <code>/jobs/2341</code>?
        Or vice-versa?</p>

      <p>Our answer is as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>Two server paths express a dependency if either path is the starting path of the other.</blockquote>

      <p>So:</p>

      <table class="table">
        <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Path Updated</th>
          <th>Path Read</th>
          <th>Dependency?</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>/foo</td>
          <td>/bar</td>
          <td>NO</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/foo</td>
          <td>/foo</td>
          <td>YES</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/foo/bar</td>
          <td>/foo</td>
          <td>YES</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/foo</td>
          <td>/foo/bar</td>
          <td>YES</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/foo</td>
          <td>/foo#bar</td>
          <td>YES</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/foo/doh</td>
          <td>/foo/bar</td>
          <td>NO</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/foo#doh</td>
          <td>/foo#bar</td>
          <td>NO</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Explicit Dependencies</h3>

      <p>The dependencies above are managed implicitly by Intercooler and, with reasonable layout of your restful
      URLs, should handle many cases.  However, there are inevitably going to be times when you need to
        express dependencies explicitly.  In Intercooler, you can use the
        <a href="/attributes/ic-deps.html"><code>ic-deps</code></a> attribute to express additional paths that an
      element depends on.</p>
